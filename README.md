## Description:
* Bamazon will be a command line interface app, it takes in a database list of products and displays them in the terminal for a user to purchase. Or a manager to update.
* Bamazon takes in a command from the terminal, using the command line. Node then makes a call to a specific database(MySQL) and retrieves certain information to present to the user.
* My goal of this project is to understand Back-End Programming and how to utilize NPM's, Modules, Node, and MySQL along with importing and exporting data.

## Instructions:
1. Fork the repo
2. Open the code in your prefered code terminal
3. Open your terminal
4. Open your favorite database SQL
5. Copy the SQL code from the code terminal and paste into your database terminal
6. Going back to your code terminal, open bash
7. Run "node bamazonCustomer.js" in the terminal opened for bamazonCustomer.js
8. Or run "node bamazonManager.js" in the terminal opened for bamazonManager.js
9. Follow the instructions and have some fun with it
